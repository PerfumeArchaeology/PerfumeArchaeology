👋 Hi, I’m @PerfumeArchaeology

- 👀 I’m interested in the fascinating world of fragrances and the art of perfume creation. Exploring the history, chemistry, and cultural significance of perfumes is my passion.

- 🌱 I’m currently working about fragrance formulation techniques, including data-driven approaches using Python. I'm also diving into the rich history of perfumery to uncover hidden gems and forgotten stories.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to fragrance formulation, scent analysis, and perfume history. Whether it's sharing knowledge, developing tools, or creating resources, I'm eager to collaborate with fellow enthusiasts and experts in the field.

- 📫 You can reach me via email or connect with me on GH.



- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that ancient civilizations used fragrances not only for personal adornment but also for religious rituals, medicine, and even as currency? Perfume has a rich and storied history that spans thousands of years!
